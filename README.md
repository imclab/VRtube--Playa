# VRtube--Playa
v0.0.2

Welcome to the VRtube holographic player source code!
In order to actually watch holograms on an Oculus Rift, you'll need to download a holographic recording from VRtube (We have a free demo up that you can use).


We'd really like to see some inverse kinematics on the avatar, and some cooler environments.

If you have any questions, please hit me up at source@vrtube.xxx
